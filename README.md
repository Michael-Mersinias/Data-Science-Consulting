# Portfolio of Data Science Consulting Projects

## FoodHub (Online Delivery Services)

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. 

We perform the data analysis to find answers to certain questions that will help the company to improve the business. 

## ENews Express (Journalism and Media)

The design team of the company has researched and created a new landing page that has a new outline and more relevant content shown compared to the old page. In order to test the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers, the Data Science team conducted an experiment by randomly selecting 100 users and dividing them equally into two groups. The existing landing page was served to the first group (control group) and the new landing page to the second group (treatment group). Data regarding the interaction of users in both groups with the two versions of the landing page was collected. 

We explore the data and perform a statistical analysis (at a significance level of 5%) to determine the effectiveness of the new landing page in gathering new subscribers for the news portal by answering the following questions:

- Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing landing page?
- Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?
- Does the converted status depend on the preferred language?
- Is the time spent on the new page the same for the different language users?

## ReCell (Telecommunications)

The rising potential of this comparatively under-the-radar market fuels the need for an ML-based solution to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices. 

We analyze the data provided and build a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone/tablet and identify factors that significantly influence it.

## INN Hotels (Hospitality)

The increasing number of cancellations calls for a machine-;earning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal, they are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out for data-driven solutions. 

We analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

## EasyVisa (Public Administration)

In FY 2016, the OFLC processed 775,979 employer applications for 1,699,957 positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications. This was a nine percent increase in the overall number of processed applications from the previous year. The process of reviewing every case is becoming a tedious task as the number of applicants is increasing every year. The increasing number of applicants every year calls for a machine-;earning based solution that can help in shortlisting the candidates having higher chances of VISA approval. OFLC has hired the firm EasyVisa for data-driven solutions. 

We analyze the data provided and, with the help of a classification model, facilitate the process of visa approvals and recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.

## ReneWind (Energy)

Generally, the cost of repairing a generator is much less than the cost of replacing it, and the cost of the inspection is less than the cost of repair. ReneWind is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. They have shared a ciphered version of the data, as the data collected through sensors is confidential (the type of data collected varies with companies). Data has 40 predictors, 20000 observations in the training set, and 5000 in the test set. 

We build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generators could be repaired before failing/breaking to reduce the overall maintenance cost.

## TradeAhead (Finance)

TradeAhead is a financial consultancy firm that provides its customers with personalized investment strategies. They provide data comprising stock price and some financial indicators for a few companies listed under the New York Stock Exchange. 

We analyze the data, group the stocks based on the attributes provided, and share insights about the characteristics of each group.
